# Introduction To Optimization
This repository outlines the final of Or S. Naim and Sapir Kroitoro in the course of Introduction to Optimization 89589, Bar Ilan University, 2021-2022.  
We chose to write on the Multi-Objective Optimization problem in stocks. A full explanation can be found on the pdf file:
