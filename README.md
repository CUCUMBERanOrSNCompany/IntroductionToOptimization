# Introduction To Optimization
This repository outlines the final of Or S. Naim and Sapir Kroitoro in the course of Introduction to Optimization 89589, Bar Ilan University, 2021-2022.  
We chose to write on the Multi-Objective Optimization problem in stocks. A full explanation can be found on the pdf file:  
[On_Multi_Objective_Optimization_By_Sapir_Kroitoro_and_Or_S_Naim.pdf](https://github.com/CUCUMBERanOrSNCompany/IntroductionToOptimization/blob/main/On_Multi_Objective_Optimization_By_Sapir_Kroitoro_and_Or_S_Naim.pdf)

# How to use
The code requires python and the Libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Scipy, and Sklrean. Make sure to install them before.  
To run the code, please open Terminal and run the following command:  
```

```
As a result graph of alpha progress will appear.

In the event our code is not producing meaningful results, please download the following repository:

And REPLACE the files example.py and application_data.py with ours. 

Have a nice day and thank you for testing our work!
